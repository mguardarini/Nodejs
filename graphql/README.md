### Link to [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/learn/) documentation

GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.

## Getting Started

Using a node.js server? Just use express-graphql! It can automatically present GraphiQL, if you using another GraphQL service? GraphiQL is relatively easy to set up. With npm:

```
npm install --save express-graphql
```

This example implement GraphQL and Mongoose. 

### Features in Development:

  - Mutation.
  - Queries.

* Connection database (Mongodb) with [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/index.html)

* JWT
